// A question is an input dialog box that must be answered according to specific constraints. When
// an answer does not meet the constraints, they will be prompted to ask again.
//
// The semantics of questions are as follows:
//     - The player is asked a question, optionally having a message.
//     - They can try to answer the question up to three times. The answer may have constraints,
//       which will automatically be included in the message.
//     - When constraint validation fails, a dialog can be shown explaining what they are expected
//       to enter. They can then choose to try again, up to three times.
//     - The answer will be returned in the promise, or NULL when they aborted.
//
// Sequences of questions can be asked to a player by using QuestionSequence instead.
