*               Las Venturas Playground v2.90 - Car crusher                    *
*   This is a system which offers just another money earning method to LVP.    *
*   Players can drive there vehicle to there local scrap yard and get it       *
*   crushed for a specific crap value - Depending on how many modifcations the *
*   vehicle has, and the condition it is in. Each vehicle is worth different   *
*   amounts of money, such as a Banshee being worth a lot because of it's      *
*   performance, and a Sentinel being reasonable.                              *
*                                                                              *
