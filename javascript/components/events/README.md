# Event Listener
San Andreas: Multiplayer emits events with primitive dataâ€” entity Ids, unverified input coming
directly from the player, and so on. This leads to code having to repeatedly validate the input and
translate it to the higher-level instances we use in Las Venturas Playground.

The code in this module aims to unify this behaviour. Features are encouraged to use an event
listener (obtainable through `Feature.createEventListener()`) for the events they need rather than
using the globally available functionality.

```javascript
class MyFeature extends Feature {
  constructor(playground) {
    super(playground);

    const eventListener = this.createEventListener();
    eventListener.addEventListener('playerconnect', this.__proto__.onPlayerConnect.bind(this));
  }

  onPlayerConnect(player) {
    console.log(player.name);
  }
}
```

Components can also use the EventListener, but are expected to keep track of event lifetime
themselves (i.e. by calling `dispose()` at an appropriate time.)

The following events are supported on the `EventListener` class.

  * **playerconnect**: `onPlayerConnect(player : Player)`
  * **playerdisconnect**: `onPlayerDisconnect(player : Player, reason : Number)`
  * **playerlogin**: `onPlayerLogin(player : Player, userId : Number)`
