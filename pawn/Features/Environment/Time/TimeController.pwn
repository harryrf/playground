/**
 * Controlling time on Las Venturas Playground should be done through the Time controller, which
 * keeps track of what the active time is in the main world and for certain players.
 *
 * This class maintains three kinds of times for each player:
 *
 *   (1) Global Time, current time of the San Andreas world. Updates automatically. This will be
 *       used for the majority of players.
 *
 *   (2) Player Default Time. VIPs and beyond have the ability to set a custom default time, which
 *       takes precedence over the global time. This allows them to always have their time set in
 *       the evening, except when engaging in activities such as minigames.
 *
 *   (3) Player Override Time. Can be set for any player, and takes precedence over any other sort
 *       of time. Used for creating an equal playing field for e.g. minigames.
 *
 *
 * The time will be updated throughout an in-game day (the duration of which is defined in the
 * DayCycleDuration constant) using a parabola formula, because players prefer the light provided by
 * the day-time hours over the darkness of the night.
 *
 * Considering the current formula of -0.17(h-12)^2+27, day time will last for 78.6% whereas night
 * time will last for 21.4%. Assuming a cyclic duration of 60 minutes, this maps to 47 minutes of
 * day time, and 13 minutes of night time.
 *
 * Thanks to Martijn for asking Wolfram Alpha for a more optimized formula :-).
 *
 * Time updates will be distributed to all players whose times are not overridden every ten in-game
 * minutes. This will enable a smooth progression of the time, even during the hours where the
 * updates are significant (5 - 7 o'clock in the morning).
